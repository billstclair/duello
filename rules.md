## A Gentlemen’s Dice Game

### Equipment

- 30x 6-sided dice
- 2x dice cups
- Scorecard & pen.

### Setup

Each player takes 15 dice and a dice cup. Players roll 5 dice canceled beneath their cups, such that their opponent cannot see them. These dice are called the player’s “target.” Players may inspect their own target at any time. Players then roll their remaining 10 dice such that they are exposed on the playing surface. These dice are called the player’s “stock.”

### Gameplay

Each turn, players may take 1 of 3 actions. Players indicate they are ready to take their actions by making the “thumbs-up” gesture. When both players have indicated they are ready, they simultaneously pound their fists in their palms 3 times and then make a hand gesture to indicate their chosen action. If players declare the same action, it does not matter which order they complete them in. In the case of both players “Taking Aim” on the same turn (see below), players may move stock dice to and remove them from the middle of the playing surface as desired, until both indicate that they are satisfied with their choices. If players declare different actions, the actions are taken in a specific order. The names, order, gestures, and descriptions of the actions are as follows:

- Reroll
  - Resolution order: 1st.
  - Gesture: Flat hand extended palm, up. 
  - Description: The player may preroll any number of their stock dice.
- 2nd. Take Aim 
  - Resolution order: 2nd.
  - Gesutre: Make a ring with thumb and forefinger (the “okay” symbol).
  - Description: The player may select any number of their stock dice and place them forward, near the middle of the playing surface. There player’s goal is to select dice that match their opponent’s target dice. Their opponent then indicates which selected dice do not match their target, and the player sets those dice aside, leaving the correct dice in the middle. The player should take care to leave the incorrect dice with the same side up, as a record of which dice do not match their opponent’s target dice.
- Take a Shot
  - Resolution order: 3rd.
  - Gesutre: Point with forefinger.
  - Description: The player states aloud their guess as to what their opponent’s target dice are. The must make a single guess for each one of their opponent’s target, no more, no less. The player may take a shot on any turn, even their first turn of the round. Naturally, the player will want to state all the correct dice from taking aim, and avoid stating the incorrect dice. Their opponent then reveals their target dice and discards those the player stated correctly. If the player starts their turn with no dice remaining in their stock (and is thus unable to preroll or take aim), they must take a shot. The player cannot “pass” their turn.

If both players take a shot on the same turn, the round ends. If, instead, only one player takes a shot but does not correctly guess all of their opponent’s target dice, their opponent may take an additional number of turns equal to their remaining target dice. They must take a shot on the last of these extra turns.

If both players have have target dice remaining after they both have taken a shot, players discard all dice that were used or guessed during the round, retaining their unused stock and target dice. Players then reroll their remaining target dice concealed under their cups, and reroll their remaining stock dice exposed on the player surface. Players then play another round the same as before, though with less total dice.

### Endgame & Scoring

If both players have target dice remaining after 3 rounds, the game ends. The player with the most remaining target dice wins, and scores points equal to the different between the number of their remaining stock and target dice and those of their opponent, scoring a minimum of 1 point. If tied for remaining target dice, the player with the most remaining stock dice wins, and scores accordingly. If tied for remaining stock dice as well, the game is a draw and no points are scored. If desired, a winner can be determined by the following tie-breaker mechanic: Players roll 1 die each, and the player with the higher roll wins and scores 1 point. Players should agree before the start of the game as to whether the will employ the tie-breaker mechanic.

If both players lose all their target dice on the same turn, the player with the most remaining stock dice wins and scores points as above. If tied for remaining stock dice, the game is a draw and no points are scored. Alternately, the tie-breaker mechanic can be utilized.

If only 1 player has target dice remaining at the end of a turn, that player wins the game. The winner scores points equal to the total number of their remaining stock and target dice, regardless of how many stock dice their opponent has remaining.

### Playing Sets

Duello: A Gentlemen’s Dice Game can be played in a set of games, if desired. Two different types of sets can be played:

- Target Score: The first player to achieve a target score wins. As the highest possible score for a single game is 15 points, the lowest recommended target score is 16 points.
- Set Number of Games: Players play a set number of games, and the player with the highest score at the end of the last game wins.

In the case of a tied score at the end of a set, players can either play another game or utilize the tie breaker mechanic. Players should decide whether to utilize the tie-breaker mechanic before the start of the set.

### Multiplayer Games

In these variants, 3 or more players can play Duello: A Gentlemen’s Dice Game at once. The multiplayer variants are:

- Round Robin Set: Each player plays every other player a set number of times. The player with the highest score at the end of the set wins. In the case of a tied score, the tied players can either play another round robin set amongst themselves, or the tie-breaker mechanic can be employed.
- Mexican Standoff: Players sit in a circle, and each player targets the opponent to their left. When a player loses all their target dice, they are knocked out of the game and play proceeds without them. If 2 or more players have target dice remaining after 3 rounds, the player with the most remaining target dice wins, and scores points equal to the different between their total remaining number of stock and target dice and their opponent with the second highest total remaining dice, scoring a minimum of 1 point. If 2 or more players are tied for remaining target dice, players instead compare their remaining stock dice and score accordingly. If 2 or more players are tied for remaining stock dice as well, utilize the tie-breaker mechanic, with the winner scoring 1 point.

### Playing for Stakes

Two options exist when playing for stakes:

-- Per Point: Players agree upon a set stake per point. If playing a set of games, the winner is payed equal to the difference between their final score and their opponent’s. If playing a multiplayer set, the winner is payed equal to the difference between their final score and each of their individual opponents’.
-- Wagering: Like in poker, at the start of each turn, players may place a bet, which must be called or raised by their opponent(s) to stay in the game. At the end of the game, the winner takes all. Players should decide who will place the first bet for each turn at the start of the game, with following bets proceeding to this player’s left. If playing a set of games, the player to make the first bet rotates to the left at the start of the next game.
