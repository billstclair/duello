[Duello: A Gentlemen's Dice Game](https://gibboygames.com/duello/) was invented by Chris St. Clair. Rules are in [rules.md](rules.md).

For development:

    cd ~/.../duello
    elm reactor
    
Then aim your browser at http://localhost:8000/site/index.html

After code changes, use `bin/build` to create `site/elm.js`, then reload the browser window.
